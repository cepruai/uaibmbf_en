# First results of the Input-Output-based model COFORCE

<p style=”text-align: justify;”> During the <a href="http://www.gws-os.com/de/index.php/the-gws/io-workshop-overview/input-output-workshop-2018.html"> I-O-workshop from 15th to 16th March 2018</a> in Bremen, Loreto Bieritz presented the first results of the project <a href="http://www.gws-os.com/de/index.php/economic-and-social-affairs/projects/project-details/cu_cl.html"> Development of Sustainable Mining Strategies in Chile with a Regionalized National Model (BMBF FKZ: 01DN16030)</a>, which analyses copper mining in Chile in its relevance for the Chilean economy. In her presentation, Ms Bieritz gave a brief introduction to the <a ref="http://www.gws-os.com/de/index.php/economic-and-social-affairs/models/model-details/coforce.html">COFORCE</a> model and illustrated production, employment, value added and productivity in each economic sector in its present and future development. On the basis of a detailed analysis of the Chilean mining sector, she explained that copper mining plays a key role and what are the advantages and disadvantages for the Chilean economy.</p>
